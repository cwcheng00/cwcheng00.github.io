Taipei Tour Guide Association Web Page (guide.org.tw)

This github was to host Taipei Tour Guide Association web page from 2013 to 2018, February. I was the system administrator for this association. I sent newsletters to all members, checked the email address from time to time (service@guide.org.tw), tried to promote our association's business at Weibo, FB, Line groups.

In addition, I received information from government and other associations and made them as e-files. I passed the information to all members.

This association was a non-profit organization. This is a volunteer position.
